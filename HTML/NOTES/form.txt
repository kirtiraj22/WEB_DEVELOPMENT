FORM TAG:
the <form> tag is used to create an html form for user input

The <input> html element is used to creat interactive controls for web-based forms in order to accept
data from the user.We have to write inside the <form> tag.

syntax:

<input type = "text" name = "username">

here type is an attribute.we can have multiple values in type attribute.

LABEL ELEMENT:
the <label> element defines a label for several form elements.
the <label> element is useful for screen reader users,because the screen-reader will read out
loud the label when the user focus on the input element.

syntax : 
<label for="username"></label>
<input type="text" id = "username>

NOTE : the for attribute in the <label> tag should have same value as the id attribute in <input> tag 
so that the elements will bind together
