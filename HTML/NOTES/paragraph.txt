<p> element defines a paragraph

the browser automatically removes extra spaces or lines when it is displayed



HORIZONTAL RULES:

<hr> tag is used to bring break in html page.
it is most often displayed as a horizontal rule 
it is used to seperate content in an html page

BREAK LINES:

the <br> element defines a link break
we can use br for a new line without starting a new paragraph

PREFORMATED TEXT:
to show the lines and spaces as it is in the html page, we use preformated text
the contents inside would be displayed as it is

eg:

<pre>
hi 
there
</pre>

output:
hi 
there

but if we use paragraph instead of preformated text then:
<p>
hi
there
</p>

output:
hi there 

so we can see that paragraph avoids any white space between two words
