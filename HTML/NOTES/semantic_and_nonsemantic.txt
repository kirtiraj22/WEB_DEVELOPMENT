SEMANTIC ELEMENTS : elements with a meaning
for eg:
<header>
<nav>
<main>
<section>
<table>
<form>
<footer>


NON-SEMANTIC ELEMENTS : elements with no meaning
eg:
<div>
<span>


many websites contain html code like:

<div id = "nav">
<div class = "header">
<div id ="footer"> 
this is to indicate navigation,header and footer respectively


but now in html55 there are some semantic elements that can be used to define different parts of webpage directly
eg:
<header>
<nav>
<footer>
