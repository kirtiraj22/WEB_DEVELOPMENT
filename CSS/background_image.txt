=>BACKGROUND IMAGE : we can include an image in a background with this property
syntax:
background-image: url('image.png');

-here if we use background-image it will be repeated many times so to avoid it we need to use
background-repeat: no-repeat;

-if we want to repeat the image horizontally then we need to write
background-repeat: repeat-x;

-if we want to repeat the image vertically then we need to write
background-repeat: repeat-y;

-if we want the single image to be perfectly alligned in center with proper  height then we need to use"
background-size: 100% 100%;

-if we want to control the scrolling of an image in the background the we need to use
background-attachment: fixed;
